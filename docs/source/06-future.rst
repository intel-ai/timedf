Areas for future development
============================

List of desired features:

#. Simplify ``benchmark-run`` script and add benchmark-specific arguments

#. Add command to load benchmark data

#. Benchmark platform that you can run with single command on any host to get benchmark result to compare hosts
  
    #. We will need to solve dataset distribution for that task

#. Result validation to validate results between backends
